In this game, the player can progress through many levels. As the levels get higher, ships become faster, shoot faster, 
and have more health. There are four tiers of ships per level: easy, medium, hard, and boss. Each tier of ship has their 
set of health, missile speed, flight speed, and artwork. Once the boss is destroyed, the game will progress to the next
level automatically.
